Theming
========

To develop a new theme follow these steps:

1. Copy `htdocs/theme/default/` to `htdocs/theme/YOUR_THEME_NAME`.
1. Call `node setup.js` and choose your new theme `YOUR_THEME_NAME`.
1. Run `gulp watch` to start the SASS- & JS-compiler. This will also reload your browser on theme changes if you have the [LiveReload plugin](http://livereload.com/extensions/) installed.
1. Start making modifications to your copied theme files.
