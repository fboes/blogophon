* Siple and fast templating via Mustache.
* Generate all required teaser pages.
* Generate all required tag pages.
* Scale images and remove unneccessary cruft.
* Puts all relevant meta stuff into `<head>` for SEO and social sharing.

Installation
------------

1. Clone this repository to your webserver.
1. Set your web server's document root folder to `htdocs` of this project (as there will be the HTML files generated by the Blogophon Generator).
1. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
1. Create the `user/config.json` from `user/_config.json` and fill out the necessary variables.
1. Optional: Change the template files in `theme`.

How it works
------------

Almost all stuff you will be doing with Blogophon is done via command line. Or just call [`./blogophone.js`](blogophone.js), so you will not need any manual at all.

If you do not want to use [`./blogophone.js`](blogophone.js), this is the manual:

### Create a new article

1. Create a new Markdown file in `user/posts` (e.g. by using [`./blogophone.js`](blogophone.js) and selecting "Create new article").
1. Generate HTML files either automatically or manually (see below).

### Generate HTML files automatically

1. Start Gulp watcher via `gulp watch`.
1. Edit your Markdown file. Gulp will automatically create all HTML files via the Blogophon Generator.

### Generate HTML files manually

1. Edit your Markdown file.
1. Run [`./index.js`](index.js) to make the Blogophon Generator generate all HTML files.

`index.js` has some options:

* `--force`: Create _all_ articles anew, ignoring cached versions.
* `--deploy`:  Execute `deploy` command found in `user/config.json`.

### Using drafts

If you want to write an article without publishing it, you can append a `~` to your Markdown file. This will hide it from the Blogophon Generator. To publish it, simply remove `~` from your Makrdown filename and follow the generator process above.

### Delete articles

If you want to completly delete an article, you will have to delete all HTML- and Markdown files as well as any images associated with the selected article. At least for this actions it is wise to use [`./blogophone.js`](blogophone.js).
