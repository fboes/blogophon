![](docs/blogophon.png) Blogophon
=========

A small and simple [Static Site Generator](https://davidwalsh.name/introduction-static-site-generators) for blogs. A live example of this blog generator can be found at [3960! Journal](http://journal.3960.org).

**Features**

* The Blogophon generates static HTML files from [Markdown articles](docs/markdown.md). These HTML files can be synchronized to remote servers and are fully independent of the Blogophon generator.
* It uses simple, fast and [hackable templating](docs/theming.md) via Mustache. It also supports multiple themes.
* Generates a bunch of way to find your articles: Regular index pages, tag pages, author pages.
* The Blogophon comes with a built-in image-scaler, which leads to responsive images.
* The default them puts all relevant meta stuff into `<head>` for SEO and social sharing (via schema.org and OpenGraph).
* A ton of [special features](docs/special-features.md) like ATOM, RSS, AMP, etc.

Installation
------------

1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed by calling `node -v`.
1. Clone this repository to your webserver.
1. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
1. Run `npm start` to start the configuration dialog and enable [special features](docs/special-features.md).
1. Set your web server's document root folder to `htdocs` of this project (as there will be the HTML files generated by the Blogophon Generator).

How it works
------------

The basic work-flow is this:

1. Create a Markdown article (see [Blogophon's Markdown reference](docs/markdown.md) on details).
2. Generate HTML files from your Markdown article via the Blogophon generator.
3. Optional: Publish your HTML files to a remote server.

Just call `npm start` to open the Blogophon command menu. There you will be able to create, edit, generate and publish Markdown articles.
